## TMS - Transportation

The TMS software component is implemented in a polyglot microservice architecture. In particular the TMS Transportation component
is a self-contained module that targets a business functionality and contains all application layers necessary to implement that
function. The only accessible interface is the public API defined and implemented by the microservice implementation.

## Functional Scope

The Transportation component offers essential functionality used to monitor and control transport orders established
in a warehouse.
